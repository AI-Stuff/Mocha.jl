Pre-training with Stacked De-noising Auto-encoders
==================================================

In this tutorial, we show how to use Mocha's primitives to build stacked
auto-encoders to do pre-training for a deep neural network. We will work with
the MNIST dataset. Please see :doc:`the LeNet tutorial on
MNIST </tutorial/mnist>` on how to prepare the HDF5 dataset.
